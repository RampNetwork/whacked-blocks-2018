## CDP pre-liquidator
In Maker ecosystem, your [CDP](https://crypviz.io/knowledge-database/collateralized-debt-position/) automatically gets liquidated when its collateralization level gets below 150%. This means 13% penalty on the collateralized funds, which is pretty bad. The idea is to create a set of smart contracts that would hold DAI and close your CDP before its collateralization reaches 150%, and then take smaller fee than 13%. Your smart contract’s DAI should be funded by a community of investors that would later earn a fee from “saved” CDPs.
***

## Lending platform holding NFTs as collateral
Use non-fungible tokens as collateral to borrow DAI. Value of exact token should be determined in the process of an auction (for example, a reverse dutch auction).
***

## Typescript typings for DAI.js
[dai.js](https://github.com/makerdao/dai.js) is currently missing typescript types definitions. Create as strict and helpful types as possible by using string literals, union types, and strict event emitters.
***

## Keepers re-implementation using DAI.js
The Maker system provides various opportunities for profit which help to maintain market equilibrium. Strategies to arbitrage these opportunities can be codified as keepers - automated bots which can detect and trade inefficiencies across Dai Core, OasisDEX and various other exchanges.

[Here](https://developer.makerdao.com/keepers/) you can read more currently exisitng keepers. Re-implement one of those in node.js using DAI.js!

## Better visualisation tools for MAKER ecosystem
Create tools that help exploring MAKER ecosystem. You might want to use [maker dashboard](https://dai.makerdao.com/) and [MKR Tools](https://mkr.tools/)) as inspiration.

# Tokens
***

## Implement one of the new ERC token standards
While ERC20 and ERC721 are very well known, there are some other token standards that had little adoption so far:

* ERC 621 allows for the modification of totalSupply
* ERC 804 separation of voting rights from the tokens
* ERC 1203 multi-class tokens (i.e. multiple ERC20 tokens on one contract, ERC 721 style)
* ERC 1404 security token (aka SRS-20)

Build something like [TokenFactory](https://tokenfactory.surge.sh/), but implementing one of these standards.
***

## Token metadata viewer
There is a lot of data related to tokens and contracts floating around off-chain. Websites/Social media links related to the contract owners, logos and so on. There is an open-source list of such metadata here: https://github.com/ethereum-lists/Methadata - the current interface is far from perfect, and it would be nice to have a browser for it, perhaps with an option to submit extra information.
***

## Tokens issued/distributed by oracles
Right now, the majority of tokens are issued and distributed by on-chain mechanisms: auctions, airdrops, ICOs.

Build a new token that is issued by an oracle based on specific criteria. Examples:
 * An oracle/daemon that watches Wikipedia editor pages, and issues THANK-YOU tokens to all the editors that publish an ethereum address on their page
 * An oracle/webserver that awaits an upload of an image, and if the image is uploaded, releases an ERC-721 token associated with it
 * A simple web game that releases tokens as points in the game (this might require POA for cheaper transactions, and may tie in nicely with Hoard.Exchange)
***

## Token recycler ;)
There is a growing issue of trash tokens - the ones airdropped en masse, ones from failed ICOs, or past-their prime Cryptokittens.

It would be useful to have a contract that accepts all the ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, and recycles them into some new kind of a token. For example, the user deposits 100 DAO, 500 AIRDRP, and four old CryptoKitties, and received 1000 RECYCLE tokens - just as useless, but so much neater! :)

<!--- (HINT: Make sure the token can't be abused. Maybe look at gas usage?) -->

## Decentralized Identity Verification
**Context:**

Trust is a Network. You trust those you know. Or those who are recommended by those you know. Or those who are verified (and can present proof) from an organization you know.
![Trust Network](img/SL-trust-network.jpg)
But in the decentralized world we often want to be able to handle things without big organizations. So how can you trust someone's identity?

**Tech:**

Design a prepare a program that verifies identities of people in a fully decentralized way. Addresses self declare their identity and other addresses that declared their identity can either confirm it or report it's fake (or got taken over). You can use any technology you like, even abstract the blockchain as two methods:

```
storeForever(Timestamp t, String smallData)

Tiemstamp[] isRecorded(String smallData)
```
and the general network to
```
sendMessage(Address adr, String msg)
broadcasMessage(String msg)

String[] getMessages()  // for a given address
```

Two variants might be interesting usefull:

1. A system that reports absolute trust in someones identity based on the network of confirmations (imagine each verification as an edge of the graph)

1. A system that reports trust customized for your address based on the nodes you trust.

**Bonus points**
- If you are able to build a cool visualization of the trust network. For visaulization you can use anything from vis.js, graphviz, unity, up to Unreal Engine if that is not overkill for you.
- If you are able to make your app interactive and allow an interactive attack simulation (maybe you can even make that into a game?)

**Problems to consider**

Design the system so it is resilient to an attacter that has a few trusted addresses under his/her controll (so he cannot easilly quickly go from a few to a few million).





## Probabilistic transaction settlement
Context:
- Blockchain-based systems tend to be final, with atomic transactions
- in FIAT-based systems on the other hand, transactions are not final, possible partial transfer of funds
- Such problems tend to be resolved by underwriting and credit scoring in the real world
- You can also consider applying some mechanisms from payment protection insurances https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_protection_insurance

Tech:
1. Create smart contract which “randomly” (use a crude pseudo randomness) finalizes transactions
2. Create smart contract wrapper which allows to use such “not final” transaction token in 0x swaps
3. Use Dharma or other loan system to provide instant settlement for “standard blockchain system” side of transaction (you can use “started transaction token” as a collateral).
***

## Multicurrency ‘blockchain credit card’

Context:
  - Work on a smart contract that would serve users with a blockchain credit card
  - The contract should allow users to receive any token they wish to use as a line of credit
  - This would largely increase convenience of using dApps without a need for purchasing and exchanging ETH and/or tokens each times they are needed to perform action in a dApp.

Tech:
  - Dharma.js for accessing a line of credit in ETH
  - 0x protocol to exchange ETH for token needed by the user
  - PISP integration [see Open Banking related challenge to get some more info about PISPs] for automatic periodic repayment of the line of credit

Extra points:
  - How these unsecured personal loans should be granted and underwrited? Hint: you can pull borrower's' identity  and payment history using AISP.

## Open Banking meets blockchain
Use Open Banking (think bank database read/write access) to connect bank world with blockchain one.
***

### Use cases
 * copy Tether system (but pls make it auditable, k?)
 * Issue you own stable coin using funds stored in your private bank account ($CEB - cebulion token network)
 * api wrapper smart contract <-> OBP - programmatic money
 * Blockchain credit card [see previous challenge]

### Technical details

Connect to OBP APIs and set up an oracle that gets data from https://openbankproject.com/
You can use:

## Oraclize

There is a wealth of data produced by public institutions. Oraclizing them could enable interesting and fun applications.

Create an oracle publishing data to blockchain. Some cool data feeds you might find interesting (there are some others, you can get creative):
* KRS https://mojepanstwo.pl/api/krs
* Sejm https://mojepanstwo.pl/api/sejmometr
* NBP http://api.nbp.pl/en.html

Then, on top of that, create blockchain application using public data. Ideas:
* a prediction market
* a DAO that maps shareholder breakdown of a given company
* a tokenized politician?

You may find Oraclize.it useful to prototype faster: http://docs.oraclize.it/#ethereum

# Exchange
***

## Create NFT exchange / auction system

How to create exchange on illiquid, non fungible tokens with effective price discovery mechanism?
How to implement effective order matching solution in this case?

Possible angles:
 * Use etherdelta system
 * Reverse dutch auction - eg. you may use DutchX sourcecode
 * Hybrid off/onchain system
 * Generalise cryptokitties auction mechanism
 * How to predict price of such asset - price feeds
 * Data visualisation of real NFT auctions
 * ...
